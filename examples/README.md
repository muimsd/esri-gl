# esri-gl Examples

This directory contains example applications demonstrating how to use the `esri-gl` library with different mapping frameworks and build tools.

## Available Examples

### MapLibre + React + TypeScript
üìÅ **[maplibre-react-dynamic](./maplibre-react-dynamic/)**
- Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
- Mapping Library: MapLibre GL JS
- Build Tool: Vite
- Features: Dynamic layers, server-side labeling, styling, filtering, and feature identification

### React Integration Examples
üìÅ **[react-integration](./react-integration/)**
- Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
- Mapping Library: MapLibre GL JS and Mapbox GL JS
- Build Tool: Vite
- Features: React hooks, components, and integration patterns for esri-gl

## Running Examples

Each example is a standalone project with its own dependencies:

```bash
# Navigate to an example
cd examples/maplibre-react-dynamic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Local Development with esri-gl

If you're developing esri-gl locally and want to test with these examples:

### Option 1: Local dist workflow (default)

1. From the repository root, build the library so the `dist` package is available:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
2. Inside the example directory:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

Each example depends on `file:../../dist`, so `npm install` will consume your freshly built bundle. If the `dist` package is missing, installation will exit with a helpful message.

### Option 2: npm link

You can still use `npm link` if you prefer hot-reloading the source version:

```bash
npm run build
npm link
cd examples/<example-name>
npm link esri-gl
npm run dev
```

## Contributing Examples

We welcome additional examples! When contributing:

1. Create a new directory under `examples/`
2. Use a descriptive name format: `{mapping-library}-{framework}-{feature}`
3. Include a comprehensive README.md
4. Ensure the example runs with `npm install && npm run dev`
5. Use the latest stable versions of dependencies
6. Add TypeScript support when possible
7. Include proper error handling and loading states

## Example Ideas

Some ideas for additional examples:

- `mapbox-vanilla-js` - Pure JavaScript with Mapbox GL JS
- `maplibre-vue-composition` - Vue 3 with Composition API
- `mapbox-angular-standalone` - Angular with standalone components
- `maplibre-svelte-kit` - SvelteKit application
- `mapbox-nextjs-app-router` - Next.js with App Router
- `maplibre-electron-desktop` - Electron desktop application
